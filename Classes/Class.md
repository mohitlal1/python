# Classes:

Class and instance variables:  In Python, class definitions begin with a class keyword.

# Class variable: 
Class variables are defined within the class construction. Because they are owned by the class itself, class variables are shared by all instances of the class.

# Instance variable: 
Instance variables are owned by instances of the class. This means that for each object or instance of a class, the instance variables are different. 

# Private Variables: 
Adding two underlines(__) at the beginning makes a variable or a method private is the convention used by most python code. Private variables in python is more or less a hack: the interpreter intentionally renames the variable.

# Inhertiance: 
Inheritance allows us to define a class that inherits all the methods and properties from another class. Parent class is the class being inherited from, also called base class. Child class is the class that inherits from another class, also called derived class.
			
# Multiple Inheritance: 
A class can be derived from more than one base class in Python, similar to C++. This is called multiple inheritance.
