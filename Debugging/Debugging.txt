Debugging a buggy code:

Python has a built-in debugger called pdb. The easiest way to use pdb is to call it in the code youâ€™re working on.

import pdb; pdb.set_trace()

list(l): The list(l) command will show you the code line the Python interpreter is currently on.

up(p) and down(d): These are the two commands needed to navigate through the call stack

step(s) and next(n): These, help you continue the execution of the application line by line.

break(b): The break(b) command allows you to set up new breakpoints without changing the code.

To execute the application with the debugger, use the command python -m pdb <python script>.
