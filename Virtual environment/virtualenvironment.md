# Virtual environment: 
A virtual environment is a tool that helps to keep dependencies required by different projects separate by creating isolated python virtual environments for them.

Installing virtualenv
```sh
						$ pip install virtualenv
```
Test your installation:
```sh
						$ virtualenv --version
```
# Using virtualenv: 

You can create a virtualenv using the following command:
```sh 
						$ virtualenv my_name
```					
To activate the relevant virtual environment every time you work on the project:
```sh 
						$ source virtualenv_name/bin/activate
```		
# Deactivating virtualenv:
Deactivate the virtual environment by the following command:
```sh 
						(virtualenv_name)$ deactivate
```
