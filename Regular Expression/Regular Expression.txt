Regular Expression: 

A RegEx, or Regular Expression, is a sequence of characters that forms a search pattern.

RegEx can be used to check if a string contains the specified search pattern.

Import the re module:
	import re

Code:
	import re

	#Check if the string starts with "The" and ends with "Spain":

	txt = "The rain in Spain"
	x = re.search("^The.*Spain$", txt)

	if x:
	  print("YES! We have a match!")
	else:
	  print("No match")
	  
The re module offers a set of functions that allows us to search a string for a match:
Function 	Description
findall 	Returns a list containing all matches
search 		Returns a Match object if there is a match anywhere in the string
split 		Returns a list where the string has been split at each match
sub 		Replaces one or many matches with a string	  

Code:
	import re

	#Return a list containing every occurrence of "ai":

	txt = "The rain in Spain"
	x = re.findall("ai", txt)
	y = re.search("\s", txt)
	z = re.split("\s", txt)
	a = re.sub("\s", "9", txt)
	
	print(x)
	print(y)
	print(z)
	print(a)
	
Output: 
	['ai','ai']
	3
	['The', 'rain', 'in', 'Spain']
	The9rain9in9Spain
