Modules and Packages:

Module: A module is a piece of software that has a specific functionality. For example, when building a ping pong game, one module would be responsible for the game logic, and
another module would be responsible for drawing the game on the screen. Each module is a different file, which can be edited separately.
	
Writing modules: Modules in Python are simply Python files with a .py extension. The name of the module will be the name of the file. 
	
Writing packages: Packages are namespaces which contain multiple packages and modules themselves. They are simply directories, but with a twist. Each package in Python is a directory which MUST contain a special file called __init__.py. This file can be empty, and it indicates that the directory it contains is a Python package, so it can be imported the same way a module can be imported.
