# Generator-Function :
A generator-function is defined like a normal function, but whenever it needs to generate a value, it does so with the yield keyword rather than return.
# Generator-Object : 
Generator functions return a generator object. Generator objects are used either by calling the next method on the generator object or using the generator object in a for loop.
