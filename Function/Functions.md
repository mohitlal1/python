# Functions

Functions are block of code which allow us to order our code, make it more readable, reuse it and save time. In python function name is given by using def as a keyword. 
```sh
def my_function():
    print("Hello World!")
    
my_function()    
```	
```sh
Output: Hello World!
```

To call this function we can just call the function by specifying it's name.

# Passing argument to a function:

For immutable objects: Changing immutable objects inside a function will create new instances and original instances are not changed. This is for string, number and tuple.

For mutable objects: Any changes made inside of function will affect to the instance of outside function. This is for list, dictionary, class instance.

# Assign function to a variable: 
Function name is like variable and can be assigned to variable. We can call function under that variable name.
	
# Nested Function: 
Function within a function is a nested function.

# Recursive function: 
Function calling itself inside it's body is called Recursive Function.
